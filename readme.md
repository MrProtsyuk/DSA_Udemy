# Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms

These are a collection of either leetcode problems,
or data structures and algorithms that I took notes on or created
while taking this online Udemy course.

I will also be adding interview question from the FAANG course that Andrei Neagoie provides on Udemy: Master the Coding Interview: Big Tech (FAANG) Interviews.
